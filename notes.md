this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4PAu6zFXNc) is very useful. start here.

decision tree


* beats arrangement
   * what are the classical patterns
* melody: *will expand*
* sound design
  * know your SAMPLES
    * have a goto set
  * shape: attack, decay, sustain, release
  * frequency filter: lo hi band
  * amplitude
  * echo, or reverb
  * bit stretching / shifting
  * distort: crush, vowel, smear, ...
  * everything fancy: rumble, stutter ...
* variation
  * in arrangement: beat swing, syncopate, duration, ...
  * in frequency / speed / amp / shape / velocity / tonal quality
  * LFO to modulate
  * introduce randomness
  * introduce chaos
  * introduce noise: e.g. perlin
* pan
* work with longer samples
  * sample, chop, striate
* layer up!
  * core elements: e.g. bass, running beats, ride, voice, foley, instrument, ...
  * evolution of layers
* high level
  * have an energy roadmap in [mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3lvFEsf1O0)
    * linear break:
       * transitional fx to take away some bass/low/kick
       * then build up: open up filter gradually and finally bring back the bass
    * trilogy break:
       * similar to linear: medium level, fall, rise ...
       * but followed by a cliff/silence/vocal at the end: the hang
       * then bang! high energy or dark drop
       * it's cool to do it once or twice: might get old lol
  * how to keep fresh / surprising
